      <h3 id="information">Information</h3>
      <p>
        BanMod was created primarily to prevent "toxic" players from rejoining
        after the official Among Us ban.<br />
        Unfortunately, the official Among Us ban wasn't enough and can be
        circumvented by changing the device's IP address or using a VPN!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the minimal version, but many other features have been added,
		always striving to keep it compatible with the official servers. 
        For this reason, it has some limitations and annoyances (such as waiting for messages to be sent).
		For the full mod, just search for BanMod
      </p>
