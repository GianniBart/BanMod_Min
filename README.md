### Information

BanMod_Minimal was created primarily to prevent "toxic" players from rejoining after the official Among Us ban.
Unfortunately, the official Among Us ban wasn't enough
and can be circumvented by changing your device's IP address or using a VPN!
This is the minimal version, but many other features have been added, always striving to keep it compatible with the official servers. For this reason, it has some limitations and annoyances
(such as waiting for messages to be sent).
For the full mod, just search for BanMod
